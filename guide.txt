download the code package from github, open the folder in vscode,
go to firebase and create your own configuration, put in the initializeApp section
run npm install
run npm run start



1. terminal: npx create-react-app superchat

terminal: code superchat
to open in vscode and edit

2. terminal: npm install firebase react-firebase-hooks
to install these 2 independencies


3. terminal: npm install -g firebase-tools


terminal: npm run start
to start the react app as a local host








If anyone has errors saying "firebase is not defined", or "Attempted import error: 'firebase/app' does not contain a default export (imported as 'firebase') Error" it probably means that you are using Version 9 and that things changed a bit for importing firebase. Now there is a “compatibility” option so can use the /compat folder in your imports.

So instead of :
<< import firebase from 'firebase/app'; 
     import 'firebase/firestore';
     import 'firebase/auth';         >>

use:
<< import firebase from 'firebase/compat/app'; 
     import 'firebase/compat/firestore';
     import 'firebase/compat/auth';         >>
